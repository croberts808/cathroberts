                    <strong>Why UX Design?</strong> 
                    As a computer science major, I took for granted the fact that I would become a software engineer.
                    After all, that's what most of my classmates are doing, so I should do that too, right? 
                    When I learned about the field of User Experience, however, I saw a potential to fulfill multiple 
                    passions at once. I love psychology, coding, creating art, and most importantly, helping people 
                    by taking away their struggles.

                <h3 style = "margin-left: 7px;margin-top: -3px;width: 590px"><strong>Why math?</strong> Throughout middle school and high school, I loved spending hours
                a day on complex math challenges. I felt most comfortable in math club, where I did not feel judged
                for enjoying probability, competing at math contests all over the state, and memorizing the digits of pi.
                While I primarily love design and coding, I want to always keep my passion for numbers and finding 
                beautiful solutions alive. </h3>
