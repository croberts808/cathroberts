            a day on complex math challenges. I felt most comfortable in math club, where I did not feel judged
            for enjoying probability, competing at math contests all over the state, and memorizing the digits of pi.
            While I primarily love design and coding, I want to always keep my passion for numbers and finding 
            beautiful solutions alive. </h3>
