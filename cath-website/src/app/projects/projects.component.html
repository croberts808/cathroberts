                Last December, I started a <a style = "color: #4c515b; text-decoration: underline;"href = "https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-ux-design">
                Google course through Coursera</a> to learn more about UX 	
                Design and grow my skills as a designer and researcher.

                <br> <br>
                <span id="more">There are 7 courses total, and I am currently working my way through the 4th, 
                    “Conduct UX Research and Test Early Concepts.” In the first 3 courses, I learned all about 
                    user personas, user pain points, wireframing, prototyping, empathy, accessibility, and how 
                    to create user journeys and competitive audits. 
                    <br><br>
                    In order to work through these courses, it was necessary to come up with an idea for a mobile 
                    or web application to put my newfound knowledge to work. I decided to create a floral delivery 
                    app that solves user pain points and is simple to use. Through the class, I learned how to use 
                    Figma to first create wireframes for the app, and then turn those wireframes into a prototype. 
                    See below for a walkthrough of my little app!

                During the spring 2022 semester, I created a JavaFX application for my “Foundations of Programming” course. 
                We spent the semester creating programs in Java, and our final assignment was to learn how to use 
                JavaFX and Maven to replicate the game Akari.
