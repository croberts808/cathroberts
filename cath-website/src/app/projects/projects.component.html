                During the spring 2022 semester, I created a JavaFX application for my “Foundations of Programming” course. 
                We spent the semester creating programs in Java, and our final assignment was to learn how to use 
                JavaFX and Maven to replicate the game Akari. <br> <br>

                It was my first time using the Model View Controller design pattern, and I ended up having a lot of fun 
                creating the visuals and putting it all together
